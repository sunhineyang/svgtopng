    "questions": {
      "whatIsSvg": {
        "question": "What is SVG?",
        "answer": "SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an industry-standard format for vector graphics, making it popular for technical drawings, charts, logos, and illustrations. Since vector images are drawn from a set of coordinates rather than millions of individual pixels, file sizes are usually smaller, so it's preferable to use SVG wherever possible."
      },
      "whatIsPng": {
        "question": "What is PNG?",
        "answer": "PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. Unlike JPEG, PNG has a lossless compression algorithm and supports transparency. However, because of lossless compression, file sizes tend to be higher than JPEG. PNGs are suitable for website imagery but not for high-resolution photos due to their size."
      },
      "whyConvert": {
        "question": "Why convert SVG to PNG?",
        "answer": "Although SVG isn't suitable for all use cases, there are many situations when converting SVG to PNG is useful. For example, if you need raster format for compatibility with certain applications, want to create thumbnails, or need to embed images in documents that don't support SVG format."
      },
      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does SVG to PNG conversion work?",
        "answer": "Converting an SVG image file into PNG format uses browser rendering technology. The SVG is rendered on an HTML5 canvas element, which is then converted to PNG format. This process maintains the quality while creating a raster image that's compatible with more applications."
      },
      "qualityLoss": {
        "question": "Will I lose quality when converting SVG to PNG?",
        "answer": "The conversion process maintains high quality, but since PNG is a raster format, the image will have a fixed resolution. For best results, choose appropriate dimensions during conversion. The original SVG remains scalable, while the PNG will be optimized for the specified size."
      },
      "batchConversion": {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple SVG files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our tool supports batch conversion of up to 20 SVG files simultaneously. Simply upload multiple files, configure your settings, and download all converted PNG files as a convenient ZIP archive."
