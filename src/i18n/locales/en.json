    "questions": {
      "whatIsSvg": {
        "question": "What is SVG?",
        "answer": "SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an industry-standard format for vector graphics, making it popular for technical drawings, charts, logos, and illustrations. Since vector images are drawn from a set of coordinates rather than millions of individual pixels, file sizes are usually smaller, so it's preferable to use SVG wherever possible."
      },
      "whatIsPng": {
        "question": "What is PNG?",
        "answer": "PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. Unlike JPEG, PNG has a lossless compression algorithm and supports transparency. However, because of lossless compression, file sizes tend to be higher than JPEG. PNGs are suitable for website imagery but not for high-resolution photos due to their size."
      },
      "whyConvert": {
        "question": "Why convert SVG to PNG?",
        "answer": "Although SVG isn't suitable for all use cases, there are many situations when converting SVG to PNG is useful. For example, if you need raster format for compatibility with certain applications, want to create thumbnails, or need to embed images in documents that don't support SVG format."
      },
      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does SVG to PNG conversion work?",
        "answer": "Converting an SVG image file into PNG format uses browser rendering technology. The SVG is rendered on an HTML5 canvas element, which is then converted to PNG format. This process maintains the quality while creating a raster image that's compatible with more applications."
      },
      "qualityLoss": {
        "question": "Will I lose quality when converting SVG to PNG?",
        "answer": "The conversion process maintains high quality, but since PNG is a raster format, the image will have a fixed resolution. For best results, choose appropriate dimensions during conversion. The original SVG remains scalable, while the PNG will be optimized for the specified size."
      },
      "batchConversion": {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple SVG files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our tool supports batch conversion of up to 20 SVG files simultaneously. Simply upload multiple files, configure your settings, and download all converted PNG files as a convenient ZIP archive."

    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is SVG to PNG conversion?",
        "answer": "SVG to PNG conversion transforms vector-based SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files into raster-based PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. This process converts mathematical shapes and paths into pixel-based images, making them compatible with more applications and platforms that may not support SVG format."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is SVG?",
        "answer": "SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an industry-standard format for vector graphics, making it popular for technical drawings, charts, logos, and illustrations. SVG files are composed of mathematical nodes, lines, shapes, and curves rather than pixels. Since vector images are drawn from coordinates rather than millions of individual pixels, file sizes are usually smaller, and they can be scaled to any size without quality loss."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What is PNG?",
        "answer": "PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. Unlike JPEG, PNG uses lossless compression and supports transparency, making it ideal for images that need crisp edges and transparent backgrounds. However, because of lossless compression, PNG file sizes tend to be larger than JPEG. PNGs are perfect for website imagery, logos, and graphics but not optimal for high-resolution photos due to their larger file sizes."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Why convert SVG to PNG?",
        "answer": "Converting SVG to PNG is useful in many scenarios: 1) Compatibility - PNG is supported by virtually all image viewers and web browsers, while SVG support may be limited in some applications. 2) Email attachments - Many email clients display PNG images directly but may not render SVG files. 3) Social media - Most social platforms prefer PNG/JPEG for image uploads. 4) Print materials - PNG provides consistent output for printing, while SVG rendering may vary between applications."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How does SVG to PNG conversion work?",
        "answer": "Our SVG to PNG converter works entirely in your browser using HTML5 Canvas technology. The process involves: 1) Loading your SVG file or code, 2) Rendering the SVG graphics onto a canvas element, 3) Converting the canvas content to PNG format, 4) Providing the PNG file for download. This method ensures high-quality output while keeping your files secure since no data is uploaded to external servers."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Is the conversion quality good?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our converter produces high-quality PNG images from SVG files. You can customize the output resolution to achieve the desired quality level. Higher resolutions result in sharper images but larger file sizes. The conversion preserves colors, transparency, and visual details from the original SVG, ensuring professional results suitable for web use, presentations, and print materials."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple SVG files at once?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Our tool supports batch conversion, allowing you to upload and convert multiple SVG files to PNG format simultaneously. You can upload up to 20 SVG files at once, each with a maximum size of 10MB. After conversion, all PNG files are packaged into a convenient ZIP archive for easy download."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Is my data safe during conversion?",
        "answer": "Yes, your data is completely safe. Our SVG to PNG converter operates entirely within your browser - no files are uploaded to our servers. All conversion processing happens locally on your device using client-side JavaScript. This means your SVG files never leave your computer, ensuring complete privacy and security of your graphics and designs."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What SVG features are supported?",
        "answer": "Our converter supports most standard SVG features including: basic shapes (rectangles, circles, paths), text elements, gradients, patterns, transformations, and transparency. Complex features like animations, interactive elements, and external references may not be preserved in the PNG output since PNG is a static image format."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "Can I customize the PNG output settings?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can customize several aspects of the PNG output: 1) Resolution/Size - Set custom width and height for the output PNG, 2) Quality - Choose the level of compression vs. quality, 3) Background - Keep transparency or set a solid background color, 4) Scale - Maintain aspect ratio or stretch to fit specified dimensions. These options give you full control over the final PNG result."
